// TheSuperHackers @feature W3DView material viewer edit mode.
// Writes an edited MaterialDocument back into its .w3d file. Only the material
// payloads the editor exposes are patched (see W3dChunkTree for the
// structure-preserving rewrite); everything else is copied byte-identically.
//
// Save pipeline: round-trip identity gate -> apply edits -> write <file>.tmp
// -> re-parse the tmp and verify it matches the edited document -> create
// <file>.bak (once) -> atomically replace the original. A failure at any step
// leaves the original file untouched.
